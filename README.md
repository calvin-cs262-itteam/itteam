# The EasyEats Vision
It’s a fact of life: young adults are hungry all the time for good food. Unfortunately, many of these people also have limited budgets, tools, and cooking ability. That is why The IT Team has decided to create EasyEats, a mobile recipe sharing app that is geared towards college students. Unlike Allrecipes, our app allows users to search for tags like “dorm friendly” or “few ingredients” to find recipes that work for them, no matter the circumstance. EasyEats will also seek to provide ingredient focused recipes and facilitate the communication of food costs to help users stay under budget. 

The technology that The IT Team has chosen to use to create this app is Ionic. Ionic is a web-based, cross-platform application development software that has the capability to function in a browser and on mobile devices. This will allow EasyEats to reach a larger pool of customers.
