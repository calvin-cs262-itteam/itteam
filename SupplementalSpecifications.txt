  recipe apps to create familiarity with users.

  other functions are labeled with small graphics or phrases (ie. searchbar contains placeholder text 'find a recipe...' and
  upvote and downvote buttons next to comments are small arrows).

  (retrieving recipe data, etc).
Performance:
- As long as a stable network connection exixts, EasyEats will run quickly and smoothly. Loading times should not exceed 5
  seconds.
