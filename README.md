# Vision
It’s a fact of life: young adults are hungry all the time for good food. Unfortunately, many of these teenagers are also on a tight budget. That is why *insert team name here* has decided to create *insert app name here*, a mobile recipe sharing app that is geared towards college students. Unlike Allrecipes, our app allows users to search for tags like “dorm friendly” or “few ingredients” to find recipes that work for them, no matter the circumstance. 
Our hope is that *insert app name* will provide a recipe sharing platform made specifically for college students. The limited budget, tools, and cooking ability of college students presents a unique customer with unique needs. *insert app name* will seek to meet these needs by implementing a tag system, ingredient focused recipes, and focusing on the communication of costs.
